# StreamDeck - MS Teams Focus

This AHK-script brings the current MS Teams session into focus (bringing it to the front).

I created this out of frustration with somehow never being able to find the ongoing MS Teams meeting among all other open windows.

# Prerequisites

- Windows 10 (might work on previous versions but I have not verified that).
- [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) has been installed.

# Installation

- Make sure `msteams-focus.ahk` is set to auto-start at boot.
- Link `F13`to the StreamDeck-button of your choice.
